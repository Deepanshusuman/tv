# 📺 TV.AI + QuantumWorld 🤖🌌

**TV.AI + QuantumWorld** is a cutting-edge media experience that uses **AI-powered emotional intelligence** and **quantum-inspired decision engines** to recommend and display the *right* content at the *right* time — tailored to your mind and mood.

Whether you're stressed, bored, happy, or drained — the system knows what you need to watch to feel balanced, uplifted, or calm.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Camera + Sensor Input**  
   Facial expressions, body language, and vocal tone are captured using smart home cameras and microphones.

2. **Emotion Detection AI**  
   Real-time deep learning models interpret your emotional state and mental energy.

3. **Quantum Decision Layer**  
   A quantum-inspired engine explores countless viewing possibilities (movies, music, calming visuals) and selects the one with *maximum emotional benefit*.

4. **Seamless Display**  
   Your TV, projector, or VR system plays curated content — personalized just for your *now*.

## 🛠 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tv-ai-quantumworld.git
cd tv-ai-quantumworld
pip install -r requirements.txt
python launch.py
```

```
Note: Connect a webcam or supported home camera for emotion detection. Quantum engine requires basic Qiskit installation or simulated environment.

🧪 Vision Statement
A TV that doesn’t just entertain — but heals, energizes, and understands.
Not just smart — emotionally aware and quantum-smart.

🔒 Privacy
All emotional data is processed locally unless explicitly opted-in. No recordings are stored or sent to the cloud by default.

🚀 Future Ideas
Support for personalized "emotional playlists"

Integration with smart lights and ambient sound

Quantum hardware acceleration

Multi-user emotion detection
